# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Maven multi-module Java repository. The parent `pom.xml` defines shared dependency versions and profiles.

Key paths:

- `module/src/main/java` and `module/src/main/resources`: primary Spring Boot module code and resources.
- `module/src/test/java`: tests for the `module` module.
- `leetcode-editor/src/main/java`: LeetCode solution implementations.
- `script/`, `py/`, `tool-hub/`: helper scripts and tooling (not part of the main build).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use Maven from the repo root:

1. `mvn -pl module -am clean package` — build the main module and its dependencies.
2. `mvn -pl module -am test` — run tests for the main module.
3. `mvn -pl leetcode-editor -am test` — run tests (if any) for the LeetCode editor module.
4. `mvn -DskipTests package` — full build without tests.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language level: Java 8 (`maven.compiler.source/target` set to 8).
- Indentation: 4 spaces, no tabs.
- Packages follow reverse-domain naming (e.g., `com.linger...`).
- Class names: `PascalCase`; methods/fields: `camelCase`; constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Lombok is used in the `module` module—prefer Lombok annotations over boilerplate.

## Testing Guidelines

- Testing stack: Spring Boot Test (JUnit 5 via `spring-boot-starter-test`).
- Place tests under `module/src/test/java` and name them `*Test`.
- Keep unit tests fast; add integration tests only when needed.
- Use `@Slf4j` in tests and log key assertions/results so test runs emit useful output.
- No explicit coverage threshold is configured.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Commit history follows Conventional Commits with scopes, for example:

- `feat(redisson): add like service`
- `refactor(pdf): optimize text removal`

For PRs:

1. Provide a clear description of the change and rationale.
2. Link related issues or requirements.
3. Include test evidence (commands run and results).

## Configuration & Profiles

The parent POM defines `dev` and `local` profiles. Use them for environment-specific overrides when needed (e.g.,
`mvn -Pdev test`).

## Tool Hub Frontend Guidelines

The `tool-hub/` app is a Vue 3 + Vite + Vuetify frontend.

- API wrappers live under `tool-hub/src/api`. Use the existing `tool-hub/src/utils/request.ts` axios wrapper so
  authentication headers, cookies, timeout handling, and global error behavior stay consistent.
- Feature pages live under `tool-hub/src/views`. Group larger product areas by domain, such as
  `tool-hub/src/views/community`.
- Register navigable pages in `tool-hub/src/router/index.ts`. Add `requiresAuth: true` only for pages that actually
  require login; keep read-only public pages public when possible.
- The side navigation is built from grouped router records in `tool-hub/src/components/AppNavigation.vue`. Add new
  top-level product areas as route groups, then include that group in the navigation filter.
- Prefer Vuetify components and Material Design Icons (`mdi-*`) for controls. Keep pages usable as the first screen;
  do not add marketing-style landing pages for internal tools or app features.
- Product style should feel like a polished internal tool hub: quiet, fast to scan, and immediately actionable. Prefer
  dense but orderly layouts, restrained borders, subtle shadows, and clear hierarchy over decorative card-heavy pages.
- Keep the established Tool Hub visual language consistent: use the shared CSS tokens in `tool-hub/src/main.css`,
  8px radii for cards and panels, neutral slate surfaces, blue primary actions, and small tonal accents for status or
  category cues. Avoid one-off palettes, oversized hero typography inside tool pages, and purely ornamental gradients.
- **Design tokens (`tool-hub/src/main.css`)** — all custom CSS must reference these variables instead of hardcoded hex
  colors. The token file also defines shared utility classes for common patterns.

  **Color tokens:**
  | Variable | Value | Usage |
  |---|---|---|
  | `--color-primary` | `#2563eb` | Primary actions, links, focus rings |
  | `--color-primary-light` | `#dbeafe` | Primary tint backgrounds (badges, pills) |
  | `--color-primary-dark` | `#1d4ed8` | Active/hover states |
  | `--color-surface` | `#ffffff` | Card and panel backgrounds |
  | `--color-surface-elevated` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.7)` | Glass card backgrounds |
  | `--color-bg` | `#f8fafc` | Page background |
  | `--color-text` | `#0f172a` | Primary text |
  | `--color-text-muted` | `#64748b` | Secondary text, descriptions |
  | `--color-text-subtle` | `#94a3b8` | Placeholder, disabled text |
  | `--color-border` | `#e2e8f0` | Card/input borders |
  | `--color-success` | `#16a34a` | Success states |
  | `--color-warning` | `#d97706` | Warning states |
  | `--color-error` | `#dc2626` | Error states |
  | `--color-info` | `#0ea5e9` | Info states |

  **Spacing & shape tokens:**
  | Variable | Value |
  |---|---|
  | `--radius-card` | `16px` |
  | `--radius-element` | `8px` |
  | `--radius-pill` | `9999px` |
  | `--shadow-card` | `0 4px 24px rgba(15,23,42,0.06)` |
  | `--shadow-card-hover` | `0 8px 32px rgba(15,23,42,0.10)` |

  **Shared utility classes (defined in `main.css`):**
  | Class | Purpose |
  |---|---|
  | `.glass-card` | Translucent card with backdrop blur — use for elevated content panels |
  | `.solid-card` | Opaque white card with border — use for nested sections inside a glass card |
  | `.page-container` | Max-width centered wrapper for standalone pages (not needed inside `ToolPageLayout`) |
  | `.page-header` | Flex row with `h1` + `p` — use only on pages that do NOT use `ToolPageLayout` |
  | `.section-header` | Flex row with `h2` — for sub-sections within a card |
  | `.empty-state` | Centered placeholder with icon and text — use for zero-data states |
  | `.score-bar` / `.score-text` / `.score-track` / `.score-fill` | Horizontal score meter (market views) |
  | `.chip-row` | Flex wrap container for `v-chip` groups |
  | `.up-text` / `.down-text` / `.flat-text` | Red/green/grey text for financial change indicators |

- **Vuetify theme** is defined in `tool-hub/src/main.ts` and is kept in sync with the CSS tokens above. Use Vuetify
  color props (`color="primary"`, `color="success"`, etc.) on Vuetify components rather than raw hex values.
- **Tailwind theme** in `tailwind.config.js` extends the default palette with matching `primary` and `surface` color
  scales plus `rounded-card` and `shadow-card` utilities. Prefer the shared CSS classes (`glass-card`, `solid-card`)
  over chaining Tailwind utilities for card patterns.
- The home page may keep a distinctive visual background, but it must primarily serve tool discovery. Include searchable
  or scannable entry points such as featured tools, categories, recent tools, or quick actions rather than a passive
  showcase.
- Use route metadata in `tool-hub/src/router/index.ts` as the source of truth for navigable UI. Add meaningful
  `title`, `description`, `icon`, `keywords`, and `featured` metadata when adding public pages so navigation search and
  the home launcher stay useful.
- Prefer `ToolPageLayout` for individual tool pages. Use its compact/workspace variants for full-screen work areas such
  as AI chat or data dashboards, and avoid duplicating the page title when the layout already renders one.
- `ToolPageLayout` reads `title`, `description`, and `icon` from `route.meta` automatically — do not add a second
  `<h1>` or page header inside the slot. Set `:card="false"` for full-bleed layouts (chat, canvas editors, dashboards),
  and use the default `card=true` for standard tool pages that benefit from a contained white card.
- Avoid global element styles that fight Vuetify, especially broad `button`, `input`, or `textarea` rules. If a native
  element is unavoidable, scope its styles to the page/component and make it visually compatible with Vuetify controls.
- For common UI patterns such as tables, forms, dialogs, pagination, tabs, menus, filters, and loading/empty states,
  prefer Vuetify or existing project components first. If the existing component set cannot cover the interaction
  cleanly, evaluate adding a mature, well-maintained dependency. Hand-written low-level HTML/CSS implementations should
  be the last option, used only when component-based approaches are unsuitable.
- For complex frontend interactions or domain-heavy widgets, first evaluate mature, well-maintained components or
  libraries instead of hand-rolling core behavior. Examples include financial charts, rich editors, graph/network
  visualizations, calendars, maps, drag-and-drop builders, and virtualized data grids.
- When implementing domain-specific UI, reference established industry conventions for that domain and match user
  expectations unless the request explicitly calls for a different interaction model. For example, stock charting
  should follow common brokerage/trading UI patterns such as separate time-line and candlestick views, crosshair
  inspection, standard period controls, price/volume panes, and familiar red/green market coloring.
- For frontend verification, run `npm run build` from `tool-hub/`.

## Python Backend Guidelines

The `py/` app is a FastAPI backend assembled in `py/app.py` through a dependency container from `py/bootstrap.py`.

- Local Python backend work should run inside the Conda environment `ai`. Start PowerShell sessions with
  `conda activate ai` before running Python commands, Alembic migrations, or backend tests.

- Add new backend features as domain modules under `py/<domain>/`, typically with `schemas.py`, `service.py`,
  `store.py`, and `routes.py`.
- Route factories should expose `create_router(container)` and be registered in `py/app.py`.
- Reuse the existing auth dependency pattern from `auth.routes`: `create_auth_router` stores `get_current_user` on the
  auth router, and other routers can retrieve it through `container._auth_router`.
- Keep API responses aligned with `auth.schemas.ApiResponse` unless there is a strong reason to use a different
  contract.
- Configuration belongs in `py/core/settings.py` and should be loaded from environment variables or `py/.env`.
- Runtime dependencies used by the deployed Python service must be added to `py/requirements.txt`.
- For backend verification, at minimum run `python -m py_compile` on changed Python modules. If dependencies and
  services are available, also instantiate the app with `python -c "from app import create_app; create_app()"`.

## Agent Backend Directory Rules

Keep Agent backend responsibilities concentrated and avoid recreating deleted compatibility layers.

- `py/agent_chat/` is the single entry point for the Agent workbench chat experience. It owns `/api/v1/agent/chat`,
  `/api/v1/agent/chat/stream`, intent routing, model fallback, skill dispatch, trace creation, tool call summaries,
  and response shaping.
- `py/agent_eval/` owns Agent run persistence, trace/query APIs, feedback, eval cases, retry/cancel metadata, and
  aggregate metrics. Do not move evaluation or run-history storage into `agent_chat`.
- `py/skills/` contains local skill instructions and should stay workflow-focused. Add or update a skill when a task has
  a reusable specialized process, but keep runtime orchestration in `agent_chat`.
- Do not recreate `py/agent_runtime/`, `py/project_agent/`, or `py/langchain_examples/`. Those older directories were
  removed to avoid parallel Agent implementations and stale compatibility APIs.
- New Agent tools should be small, explicit functions or classes reachable from `agent_chat` through a registry-like
  boundary. Keep tool metadata normalized with `step_id`, `node`, `status`, `input_summary`, `output_summary`,
  `latency_ms`, `error`, and `tool_name` so the frontend and eval service can consume one trace shape.
- Keep public Agent APIs under `/api/v1/agent/*`. Do not add new `/api/v1/project-agent/*` endpoints.
- For frontend Agent workbench changes, keep the UI chat-first and wire it to the real streaming endpoint instead of
  adding template buttons or fake typing flows.

## Database Guidelines

PostgreSQL is the preferred persistent store for new Tool Hub business features that need durable relational data.

- Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM for Python backend persistence and Alembic for schema migrations.
- Keep shared SQLAlchemy infrastructure under `py/db/`, ORM models under each domain module, and migrations under
  `py/alembic/versions`.
- Prefer Alembic revisions for schema changes. Raw SQL files under `py/sql/` may be kept as bootstrap/reference scripts,
  but deployed schema evolution should go through Alembic.
- Use table names prefixed by the feature domain. For the post feature, use `post_` tables such as `post_posts`,
  `post_comments`, and `post_likes`.
- Use `sys_` table names for authentication, users, roles, permissions, and other system-level account data, such as
  `sys_users`.
- Name indexes and constraints with the same feature prefix, for example `idx_post_posts_status_created` and
  `uq_post_likes_post_user`.
- Use `TIMESTAMPTZ` for persisted timestamps, with `created_at` and `updated_at` columns on mutable business tables.
- Prefer soft delete for user-generated content by using a `status` column such as `published`, `deleted`, or `hidden`.
- The Python backend reads PostgreSQL through `POSTGRES_DSN`. In URL-style DSNs, URL-encode reserved characters in
  passwords; for example `@` must be written as `%40`.
- In Docker Compose, services on `linger-net` should connect to PostgreSQL by container name, for example
  `postgres-db:5432`, not by public IP.
- When adding or changing deployed database requirements, update both the SQL schema file and any Docker/runtime
  configuration needed to reach the database. If Alembic is active for that schema, update or add an Alembic revision
  instead of relying only on a raw SQL file.

## Python Database Migration Commands

Run Alembic migrations from the `py/` directory after adding or changing SQLAlchemy models.

PowerShell local environment:

```powershell
conda activate ai
cd py
$env:POSTGRES_DSN="postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost:5432/database"
python -m alembic upgrade head
```

For the Agent evaluation tables added in revision `20260518_0004`, either migrate to the latest head:

```powershell
conda activate ai
cd py
python -m alembic upgrade head
```

or migrate directly to that revision:

```powershell
conda activate ai
cd py
python -m alembic upgrade 20260518_0004
```

Verify the applied revision:

```powershell
conda activate ai
cd py
python -m alembic current
python -m alembic history --verbose
```

If running inside Docker Compose, execute Alembic in the Python API container with the deployed `POSTGRES_DSN`:

```powershell
docker compose exec langgraph-api python -m alembic upgrade head
docker compose exec langgraph-api python -m alembic current
```

If the backend logs `Agent 评测表不可用，请先运行 Alembic 迁移`, the app can still answer Agent chat requests, but
Agent metrics and feedback will not be persisted until the migration has created `agent_runs`, `agent_tool_calls`,
`agent_feedback`, `agent_eval_cases`, and `agent_eval_results`.

## Dependency & Deployment Notes

- When adding new runtime components or protocols, update the actual deployment dependency files, not only local
  environment exports. For the Python Docker backend, `py/Dockerfile` installs from `py/requirements.txt`; packages
  listed only in `py/ai.yaml` are not included in the deployed image.
- Pay special attention to optional runtime extras required by new components. For example, FastAPI WebSocket routes
  served by Uvicorn require `uvicorn[standard]`, `websockets`, or `wsproto`; otherwise upgrade requests can be logged as
  unsupported and handled as plain HTTP requests.
- After introducing frontend features that depend on backend protocols such as WebSocket or SSE, verify both the
  browser request and the container logs in the deployed environment.

## Skill Routing

Use the local skills under `skills/` when the request clearly matches one of the workflows below. Prefer the most
specific skill that fits the task. If the user explicitly names a skill, use that skill.

- `nl-to-sql-generator`
  Use for natural language plus schema input when the task is to generate read-only SQL only. Do not execute SQL in
  this skill.

- `sql-exporter`
  Use for an existing SQL statement plus database connection details when the task is to validate, execute, or export
  query results. Do not invent SQL from a business question in this skill.

- `java-stacktrace-analyzer`
  Use for Java, Spring Boot, Maven, Gradle, JDBC, or test stack traces when the task is to identify the root cause and
  propose fixes.

## Skill Usage Notes

- Ask for missing schema details before using `nl-to-sql-generator`.
- Ask for missing SQL or connection details before using `sql-exporter`.
- For Java error analysis, prioritize the deepest actionable `Caused by` chain instead of top-level wrapper exceptions.
- Keep skill responsibilities separate. Do not let `sql-exporter` generate SQL, and do not let
  `java-stacktrace-analyzer` modify code unless the user asks for code changes after the diagnosis.
